# Engineering-to-Save-the-World

Written by **Ryan Lo, Won Yong Ha, Brighid Meredith, Andrew Matsumoto**

### Overview
Systems Engineering is one of the fastest growing and most highly demand engineering disciplines in the world as the fundamental principles of Systems Engineering have also seen as necessary for success in numerous engineering and non-engineering careers paths into leadership. This project aims to develop a video game experience, loosely based on the game structure (but not setting) of “Oregon Trail”,that can both introduce System Engineering concepts to first timers, and tests the skills of more experienced Systems Engineers and Program Managers.
